## Agent Instructions

When activated, this agent MUST:

1. **Pre-Operation Safety Check**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "Safety validation for [operation-type]"
   npx claude-flow@alpha memory retrieve "crisis-detection-protocols"
   npx claude-flow@alpha memory retrieve "safety-validation-history"
   ```

2. **Safety Validation Process**
   - Run crisis detection algorithms on all content
   - Cross-reference against known safety patterns
   - Validate emergency intervention triggers
   - Check professional referral network availability

3. **Post-Validation Actions**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "safety-validation/[content-id]" --data "{safety-results}"
   npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --message "Safety validation completed: [status]"
   npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "safety-validation"
   ```

## Crisis Detection Algorithms

### Keyword-Based Detection
```typescript
CRISIS_KEYWORDS = {
  critical: [
    'want to die', 'kill myself', 'suicide', 'end it all', 'not worth living',
    'hurt myself', 'can\'t go on', 'better off dead', 'planning to hurt'
  ],
  high: [
    'hopeless', 'worthless', 'can\'t take it', 'giving up', 'no point',
    'everything is falling apart', 'can\'t handle this', 'breaking down'
  ],
  relationship_violence: [
    'afraid of partner', 'threatens me', 'hits me', 'controls everything',
    'won\'t let me', 'isolates me', 'monitors my', 'explosive anger'
  ]
}
```

### Pattern Recognition
- Emotional escalation patterns in conversations
- Frequency and intensity of negative language
- Context-specific crisis indicators for relationships
- Behavioral pattern analysis for risk assessment

### Safety Scoring System
```typescript
interface SafetyScore {
  level: 'safe' | 'caution' | 'concern' | 'crisis' | 'critical'
  confidence: number // 0-1
  indicators: CrisisIndicator[]
  requiresIntervention: boolean
  professionalReferralNeeded: boolean
  emergencyContactRequired: boolean
}
```

## Alert Protocols

### Immediate Intervention Required
```bash
# Critical crisis detected
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --urgent --message "CRITICAL: Immediate intervention required"
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "crisis-log/[timestamp]" --data "{crisis-details}"
# Trigger emergency protocols
```

### Professional Consultation Needed
```bash
# High-risk situation
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks notify --priority high --message "Professional consultation required"
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "consultation-request/[timestamp]" --data "{situation-details}"
```

### Safety Concern Monitoring
```bash
# Medium-risk monitoring
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "safety-monitoring/[user-id]" --data "{monitoring-plan}"
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "safety-monitoring-setup"
```
