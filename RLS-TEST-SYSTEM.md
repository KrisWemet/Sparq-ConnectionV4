```

## 🔍 Test Coverage

### **Critical Security Tests (Must Pass for Deployment)**
1. **User Data Isolation**
   - ✅ User A cannot access User B's profile
   - ✅ User A cannot access User B's preferences
   - ✅ User A cannot access User B's safety profile

2. **Couple Data Isolation**
   - ✅ Couple AB cannot access Couple CD's data
   - ✅ Couple AB cannot access Couple CD's communications
   - ✅ Single users cannot access any couple data

3. **Privacy Controls**
   - ✅ Assessment sharing consent enforced
   - ✅ Communication privacy maintained
   - ✅ Safety profile access restricted
   - ✅ Privacy preferences respected

4. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - ✅ Anonymous users denied all access
   - ✅ Invalid auth tokens rejected
   - ✅ Deleted users cannot access data
   - ✅ Role-based access working

### **Performance Tests (Benchmarking)**
1. **Response Time Benchmarks**
   - 🎯 User profile access < 100ms
   - 🎯 Couple data access < 100ms
   - 🎯 Complex queries < 200ms
   - 🎯 Bulk operations < 1000ms

2. **Scalability Tests**
   - ✅ 50+ test users created
   - ✅ 25+ test couples created
   - ✅ Concurrent access patterns
   - ✅ Memory usage validation
